    <p align="center"><em>I am a suicide survivor. I do not get along with family whatsover, and I'm a coffee addict. I like sleeping and watching movies in a big, warm blanket. I stuggle with bottling up my rage and letting it out and ruining everything I built. I am a nice person at times, just don't hit me and we'll be fine. I'm a nonbinary, polyamorous, bisexual. I love the dark academia aesthetic, and I am learning how to code so that is about it.</em></p>
